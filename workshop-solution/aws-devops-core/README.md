# AWS DevOps Core
This repository contains the core DevOps infrastructure which currently includes the Pipelines used for Terraform module validation and deployment, as well as the S3 buckets used to simulate our Git repositories (via [git-remote-s3](https://github.com/awslabs/git-remote-s3)) where the configurations are stored.
